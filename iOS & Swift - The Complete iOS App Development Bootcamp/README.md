## Course Projects

1. XCode Storyboards and Interface Builder - Creating an I Am Rich App
Dr Angela used the concept of the _I Am Rich_ app on the app store as an introduction to creating display-only apps. We used 
the Xcode interface builder (main.storyboard) for this app.

3. Swift Programming Basics - Collections, Constants and Variables
Creation of this app required an understanding of variables and arrays, as well as randomisation in Swift. Lastly this section
was completed with the creation of another related app.

4. Swift Programming Basics - Coding Challenge
The concepts of the previous section is reinforced in this one through the creation of a Magic-8 ball mobile application.
