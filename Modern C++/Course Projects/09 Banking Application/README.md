## 09 Object Oriented Programming
### Banking Application 
#### Summary
This was the introductory code walkthrough the instructor used to teach Object Oriented Programming.
The goal was to create an abstract class <code>Account</code>. There are two types of accounts in the bank: 
- a <code>Savings</code> Account- which accumulates interest. 
- a <code>Checkings</code> Account - which ensures that the account has a certain minimum balance.

While the instructor compiled the program in VSCode, I used Makefiles in Atom to do the same.
